This Visual Studio solution contains a set of working projects that demonstrate the Nevron .NET 
Vision Chart working with CenterSpace's NMath and NMath Stats libraries.

To run a project, simply right click the project name in the solution explorer and select 
"Set as Startup Project", then run that project.  Both the Nevron .NET Vision Chart and the 
CenterSpace NMath and NMath Stats libraries must all be installed on your development machine prior 
to running.  Go to www.nevron.com and www.centerspace.net to download free trial verions of
these products.

Currently there are two projects in the series.

The "CurveFitting" project demonstrates:
  Data Smoothing
  Polynomial Curve Fitting
  Linear Regression

The "ControlCharts" project has implementations of the following statistical quality control charts
  p-Chart
  np-Chart
  u-Chart
  c-Chart
 This set of charts encompasses the standard set of attribute quality control charts used
 world wide.  They are sometimes collectively refered to as "Shewhart" charts after the 
 inventor Walter Shewhart.
 
 Enjoy!
